How we do releases:

2.6 was hell

Never again

Each kernel release is "stable"

Have guaranteed this for a decade (Cambridge 2007)

Numbers mean nothing, only that one is newer than another

3.x happened because my brain hurt and I bribed Linus with whisky

4.x happened, no whisky.

stable kernels, started in 2005 (predated git)

LTS - I did it because I was lazy, saved me work

2.6.16, 2.6.27 - me being lazy

2.6.32, the release that synced the world.

Pick one a year, maintain it for 2 years.

Usually the last kernel of the year.

Well, not really, some are longer than others, I blame Willy

Patch rate (6-8 a day?  Do the math...)

Rules for stable kernels:
	- correct and tested
	- no bigger than 100 lines
	- only fix 1 thing
	- fix a reported issue
	- new id or quirk
	- must be in Linus's tree
  rules are good to be able to say no.

Everything is stable
	can always update your kernel, will not break userspace
	guaranteed 10 years ago, have not violated it
	only time Linus yells at someone

SoC trees suck ass, they are on their own
	3.4million out of 3.9 running

Security!

never say what is a security bug.

Why?  Because no one knows

Linus's quote

Fix as soon as possible

Again, Linus's quote

How to keep your system secure
	- always take the latest stable update
	- will not break your system
	- do it
	- seriously, you are fool to not to.

Demo showing why this is the case (where greg breaks his phone...)
